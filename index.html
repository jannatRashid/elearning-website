            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Illiteracy is both a social-evil and a national problem for the World. Every efforts should be made by all to solve the problem of illiteracy: We should double our efforts and make it our mission now to help the poor children in their studies. Children should be encouraged to develop a taste for learning. Lacking basic reading and writing skills is a tremendous disadvantage. Literacy not only enriches an individual's life, but it creates opportunities for people to develop skills that will help them provide for themselves and their family.
                <br>
                Students that can't read
                effectively fail to grasp important concepts, score poorly on tests and ultimately, fail to meet educational milestones. Literacy skills allow students to seek out information, explore subjects in-depth and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.
                Stimulating your young child's brain cells through these early experiences will help them to become better listeners, readers, and communicators as well as instilling a lifelong love of learning
                <br>
                <b>Online Learming Provides students with more control over their learning</b>,Traditional learning methods allow the teacher to decide how they will convey information to their students, but online learning provides more flexibility and gives children control over their education.
